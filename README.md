# Registers 

> MIPS has a 32 Ã— 32-bit register file -> 32 Register Each one has 32 BITS


```assembly
# Name 				# OP-CODE 	# Description
# ____________________________________________________________________ #
$zero 				# 0			# stores the value 0 - can't be changed
$at 				# 1			# reserved for the assembler
$v0 - $v1			# 2 - 3		# Proc return values and exp eval
$a0 - $a3 			# 4 - 7 	# Proc arguments
$t0 - $t7	 	 	# 8 - 15	# for temporary values
$s0 - $s7 			# 16 - 23	# general purpose saved variables
$t8 - $t9 			# 24 - 25 	# for temporary values
$k0 - $k1 			# 26 - 27 	# reserved for the OS 
$gp 				# 28 		# Global Pointer
$sp 				# 29 		# Stack Pointer
$fp 				# 30 		# Frame Pointer
$ra 				# 31 		# Proc Return Address
```

# Arithmetic Operations Instructions 
- Three Operands, two srcs one dest
- No Immediate Operands 
```assembly
add dest, src1, src2 		# dest = src1 + src2
sub dest, src1, src2 		# dest = src1 - src2
```
- Only one Immediate Operand - src2

```assembly
addi dest, src1, c
	# No subtract Immediate Instruction, use negative constant with addi
addi dest, src1, -c
	# move data between Registers 
	# NO MOV INSTRUCTION use addition with zero 
add dest, $t1, $zero
addi dest, $t1, 0
```
## Logical Operations Instructions

```assembly
and dest, src1, src2 		# dest = src1 & src2 - performs bitwise AND between src1 and src2 and stores the result in dest
or dest, src1, src2 		# dest = src1 | src2 - performs bitwise OR between src1 and src2 and stores the result in dest
nor dest, src1, src2 		# dest = ~(src1 | src2) - performs bitwise NOR between src1 and src2 and stores the result in dest
# NO NOT INSRUCTION , USE NOR 
nor dest, dest, dest 		# dest = ~(dest | dest) = ~dest - negeate dest and stores it in dest 

andi dest, src1, c 		# and immediate - dest = src1 & c - performs bitwise AND between src1 and c and stores the result in dest
ori dest, src1, c 		# or immediate - dest = src1 | c - performs bitwise OR between src1 and c and stores the result in dest

sll dest, src1, c 		# shift logical left - dest = src1 << c - performs shift left by c on src1 and stores the result in dest - same as multiplying by 2^c 
sll dest, src1, c 		# shift logical left - dest = src1 >> c - performs shift right by c on src1 and stores the result in dest - same as dividing by 2^c 
```
## Data Transfer Instructions
- Two Operands, one srcs one dest
- $s1 + c must be divisible by 4 
```assembly
lw dest, c (base) 		# Load word - Loads a word from Mem[base + c] into dest  - base is the base address, c is the offset, dest is dest 
sw dest, c (base) 		# Store word - Stores a word from dest into Mem[base + c]  - base is the base address, c is the offset, dest is dest

lh dest, c (base) 		# Load half - Loads halfword from Mem[base + c] into dest  - base is the base address, c is the offset, dest is dest 
lhu dest, c (base) 		# Load unsigned half- Loads unsigned halfword from Mem[base + c] into dest  - base is the base address, c is the offset, dest is dest 
sh dest, c (base) 		# Store half - Stores halfword from dest into Mem[base + c]  - base is the base address, c is the offset, dest is dest

lb dest, c (base) 		# Load byte - Loads byte from Mem[base + c] into dest  - base is the base address, c is the offset, dest is dest 
lbu dest, c (base) 		# Load unsigned byte - Loads unsigned byte from Mem[base + c] into dest  - base is the base address, c is the offset, dest is dest 
sb dest, c (base) 		# Store byte - Stores byte from dest into Mem[base + c]  - base is the base address, c is the offset, dest is dest

ll dest, c (base) 		# Load linked word - Loads word as 1st half of atomic swap from Mem[base + c] into dest  - base is the base address, c is the offset, dest is dest  - dest = Mem[base + c]
sc dest, c (base) 		# Store condition word - Stores word as 2nd half of atomic swap from dest into Mem[base + c]  - base is the base address, c is the offset, dest is dest - Mem[base + c] = dest

lhu dest, c 			# Load upper immediate - Loads c into upper 16 bits of dest - dest = c * 2^16
```

## Jumps

### Conditional Jumps

- If condition is true : jump to label. else : continue sequentially 

```assembly

beq src1, src2, L 		# branch if equal - Jump to L if src1 == src2
bne src1, src2, L 		# branch if not equal - Jump to L if src1 != src2
```

### Unconditional Jumps

- Jump to label/register anyway

```assembly
j L 					# Unconditional Jump - jump to L
jal L 					# Jump and Link - Jump to proc label L and store the next line address in $ra - used to call a proc
jr $ra 					# Jump Register - Jump to the address in $ra by copying $ra value to the program counter - used to return from proc
```

## Conditionals 

```assembly
slt dest, src1, src2 	# Set Less Than - set dest if src1 < src2 else clear dest
slti dest, src1, c 		# Set Less Than Immediate - set dest if src1 < c else clear dest

sltu dest, src1, src2 	# Set Less Than unsigned  - set dest if src1 < src2 else clear dest
sltui dest, src1, c 	# Set Less Than unsigned Immediate - set dest if src1 < c else clear dest

```
