# Registers 

> MIPS has a 32 Ã— 32-bit register file -> 32 Register Each one has 32 BITS


```assembly
# Name 				# OP-CODE 	# Description
# ____________________________________________________________________ #
$zero 				# 0		# stores the value 0 - can't be changed
$at 				# 1		# reserved for the assembler
$v0 - $v1			# 2 - 3		# Proc return values and exp eval
$a0 - $a3 			# 4 - 7 	# Proc arguments
$t0 - $t7	 	 	# 8 - 15	# for temporary values
$s0 - $s7 			# 16 - 23	# general purpose saved variables
$t8 - $t9 			# 24 - 25 	# for temporary values
$k0 - $k1 			# 26 - 27 	# reserved for the OS 
$gp 				# 28 		# Global Pointer
$sp 				# 29 		# Stack Pointer
$fp 				# 30 		# Frame Pointer
$ra 				# 31 		# Proc Return Address
```

# Arithmetic Operations Instructions 
- Three Operands, two srcs one dest
- No Immediate Operands 
```assembly
add $t0, $s0, $s1 		# $t0 = $s0 + $s1
sub $t0, $s0, $s1 		# $t0 = $s0 - $s1
```
- Only one Immediate Operand - src2

```assembly
addi $t0, $s0, 4
	# No subtract Immediate Instruction, use negative constant with addi
addi $t0, $s0, -1

# how to move data between Registers ?
# NO MOV INSTRUCTION use addition with zero 
add $t0, $t1, $zero
addi $t0, $t1, 0
```
## Logical Operations Instructions

```assembly
and $t0, $s0, $s1 		# $t0 = $s0 & $s1 - performs bitwise AND between $s0 and $s1 and stores the result in $t0
or $t0, $s0, $s1 		# $t0 = $s0 | $s1 - performs bitwise OR between $s0 and $s1 and stores the result in $t0
nor $t0, $s0, $s1 		# $t0 = ~($s0 | $s1) - performs bitwise NOR between $s0 and $s1 and stores the result in $t0

# How to Negiate (NOT X) ? 
# NO NOT INSRUCTION , USE NOR 
nor $t0, $t0, $t0 		# $t0 = ~($t0 | $t0) = ~$t0 - negeate $t0 and stores it in $t0 

andi $t0, $s0, c 		# and immidiate - $t0 = $s0 & c - performs bitwise AND between $s0 and c and stores the result in $t0
ori $t0, $s0, c 		# or immidiate - $t0 = $s0 | c - performs bitwise OR between $s0 and c and stores the result in $t0

sll $t0, $s0, c 		# shift logical left - $t0 = $s0 << c - performs shift left by c on $s0 and stores the result in $t0 - same as multiplying by 2^c 
sll $t0, $s0, c 		# shift logical left - $t0 = $s0 >> c - performs shift right by c on $s0 and stores the result in $t0 - same as dividing by 2^c 
```
## Data Transfer Instructions
- Two Operands, one srcs one dest
- $s1 + c must be divisible by 4 
```assembly
lw $s0, c ($s1) 		# Load word - Loads a word from Mem[$s1 + c] into $s0  - $s1 is the base address, c is the offset, $s0 is dest 
sw $s0, c ($s1) 		# Store word - Stores a word from $s0 into Mem[$s1 + c]  - $s1 is the base address, c is the offset, $s0 is dest

lh $s0, c ($s1) 		# Load half - Loads halfword from Mem[$s1 + c] into $s0  - $s1 is the base address, c is the offset, $s0 is dest 
lhu $s0, c ($s1) 		# Load unsigned half- Loads unsigned halfword from Mem[$s1 + c] into $s0  - $s1 is the base address, c is the offset, $s0 is dest 
sh $s0, c ($s1) 		# Store half - Stores halfword from $s0 into Mem[$s1 + c]  - $s1 is the base address, c is the offset, $s0 is dest

lb $s0, c ($s1) 		# Load byte - Loads byte from Mem[$s1 + c] into $s0  - $s1 is the base address, c is the offset, $s0 is dest 
lbu $s0, c ($s1) 		# Load unsigned byte - Loads unsigned byte from Mem[$s1 + c] into $s0  - $s1 is the base address, c is the offset, $s0 is dest 
sb $s0, c ($s1) 		# Store byte - Stores byte from $s0 into Mem[$s1 + c]  - $s1 is the base address, c is the offset, $s0 is dest

ll $s0, c ($s1) 		# Load linked word - Loads word as 1st half of atomic swap from Mem[$s1 + c] into $s0  - $s1 is the base address, c is the offset, $s0 is dest  - $s0 = Mem[$s1 + c]
sc $s0, c ($s1) 		# Store condition word - Stores word as 2nd half of atomic swap from $s0 into Mem[$s1 + c]  - $s1 is the base address, c is the offset, $s0 is dest - Mem[$s1 + c] = $s0

lhu $s0, c 			# Load upper immediate - Loads c into upper 16 bits of $s0 - $s0 = c * 2^16
```
